&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O beautiful wind of the West,<BR>
In your wand'rings o'er land and sea,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have you seen in your quest?<BR>
Come, tell your story to me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the isles of the southern seas,<BR>
Where the crystal-clear ocean a melody sang<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beautiful kauri trees,<BR>
I wandered the summer day through,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest's dappled shade,<BR>
Where the graceful fern-tree bowed its head<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To woo the Maori maid.<BR>
A nymph of the woods was she<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her kiwi mantle brown;<BR>
And the fern-tree wooed her with tender grace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From dawn till the sun went down;<BR>
But a Maori chieftain came<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of life's young morn,<BR>
And the maiden forsook her mystic love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving it sad and forlorn.<BR>
But the tui-bird saw its grief,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in loving sympathy<BR>
Built her beautiful, woven nest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the lonely tree.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P6"></A>6}</SPAN>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when its liquid notes echoed the woodland through,<BR>
The fern-tree lifted its drooping head<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was fresh as the morning dew;<BR>
So I left them in their joy&mdash;the youth and his fairy bride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree with its nest of callow birds&mdash;<BR>
And I crossed the ocean tide.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the early morn I came to a land where the orchards were white<BR>
With their wealth of apple blossoms, and bathed in the spring sunlight;<BR>
There I found a winding road with banks where the wild-flowers grew,<BR>
And through a vista of blossoming trees the sea came into view,<BR>
As it sparkled in the sun and kissed the golden shore,<BR>
Then laughed aloud in its mirth and ran back to the sea once more.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And again I wandered on, until in the twilight dim<BR>
I came where the scent of the wattle seemed the incense to Nature's hymn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a brooding peace lay o'er land and sea<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sank to rest in a blue gum-tree,<BR>
And when I awoke in the dawn, the dew lay on vineyards green,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P7"></A>7}</SPAN>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where they nestled in valleys of red-hued loam;<BR>
And a river whose fount was a cascade clear,<BR>
Which burst from the brow of a mountain near,<BR>
Wended its way through the verdant land,<BR>
Till it reached at last the ocean strand,<BR>
Where it lost itself in the waters deep,<BR>
And only the mermaids saw it leap<BR>
With joy, as it reached the Garden of Sleep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And still I wandered on until I came to tropical seas,<BR>
Where the odors of spices were wafted afar by every passing breeze;<BR>
And in the pearly light of the coming day<BR>
I saw the feathery bamboo groves, where the elephant loves to stray;<BR>
I heard his mighty trump, as he waked from his dream,<BR>
And the sound of women's voices as they wended their way to the stream;<BR>
A laughing, chattering throng, they passed me on their way<BR>
To bathe in the limpid waters, ere the sun held his sovereign sway.<BR>
I followed a Purple Emperor to the cinnamon gardens near,<BR>
Then chased a laughing rickshaw boy, and whispered in his ear;<BR>
What the secret was I may not tell,<BR>
But the rickshaw boy seemed to know it well.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then I left behind me this island fair,<BR>
With its wondrous charm and fragrant air,<BR>
And ere night had fallen had crossed the sea,<BR>
And come to the land of the banyan tree,<BR>
Where nature is wrapped in mystery deep,<BR>
And the gods in the cups of the Lotus-flower sleep;<BR>
And even my spirit felt its spell,<BR>
For I scarcely breathed as the twilight fell;<BR>
And when o'er the palm-trees and temples fair<BR>
The crescent moon hung in the evening air,<BR>
And from shadowy doorways and wayside shrines near<BR>
The chant of the Koran fell on my ear;<BR>
Still more did its mystery my spirit fill,<BR>
For I felt that I only could breathe and be still.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And so on to the Isles of the West I roam,<BR>
Which the hearts of the exiles ever call home;<BR>
And I think that the primrose and hare-bells blue<BR>
Are emblems of hearts that are ever true,<BR>
And the shamrock doth also with elfin grace<BR>
Claim for itself in my heart a place;<BR>
So I whisper them each that no fairer land<BR>
Have I found in my wanderings from strand to strand;<BR>
They each have their charm and magic spell,<BR>
And loving hearts in each one doth dwell.<BR>

It was night and the tired villagers were wrapped in sleep;<BR>
Only within her lonely hut did a mother her vigil keep.<BR>
All day she had toiled and labored, carrying bricks and stone,<BR>
While her child lay sick with fever, and uttered his weary moan.<BR>
Oft she had paused in her work, and in soft, caressing tone<BR>
Had soothed his plaintive crying, then gone back to her work alone,<BR>
And now, though tired and weary, and heavy her eyes with sleep,<BR>
She sat and nursed her baby with a mother love true and deep;<BR>
And when with a last little cry he turned in her arms and was still,<BR>
She knew that no more would his baby love the place in her hard life fill.<BR>
She was only a coolie mother, but her heart was heavy with pain,<BR>
For she knew that she never would clasp her child in her lonely arms again.<BR>
What had mattered the daily toil in the heat of the burning sun,<BR>
When she knew that she had her little one to caress when the day was done?<BR>
To you he was only a coolie child with his baby limbs dimpled and bare,<BR>
But now he is one of those favored ones who are safe in their Saviour's care.<BR>

The highway was hot and dusty, oppressive the air;<BR>
The sun on the tired bullocks beat down with pitiless glare.<BR>
Mere living skeletons were they, their worn-out hides scarce covering their aching bones;<BR>
Hunger and thirst were their daily lot, while many a cruel blow<BR>
Forced them to drag their heavy load, though weary their gait and slow;<BR>
The look in their eyes was pitiful, so full of helpless pain,<BR>
While ever the cruel driver showered his blows like rain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Have ye no heart, ye men of the East, that ye treat dumb creatures so?<BR>
Does it help you to bear your own weary lot to add to their tale of woe?<BR>
Bruised and maim, half-blind, and halt, you drive them until they drop!<BR>
Oh, had I the power I would wield it, such cruelty to stop;<BR>
When I see you prod them with pointed stick, my soul cries in answering pain;<BR>
Oh, why will you treat your oxen so, and give to your land this stain?<BR>

Tired out with the heat and the burden of day,<BR>
And the miles I have walked 'neath the sun's fierce ray,<BR>
I think with delight of the bungalow dim,<BR>
And how I shall fill my long glass to the brim;<BR>
But when I arrive all is empty and bare,<BR>
The khansamah has gone to his evening prayer.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I think I will rest on the charpoi awhile,<BR>
But the mosquitoes turn out in most welcoming style;<BR>
I then in despair do betake me outside,<BR>
Still to find I am helpless to stem their fierce tide.<BR>
But wait, there's still balm for my weary soul&mdash;<BR>
I take out my pipe and fill up the bowl,<BR>
And for a few moments I have a respite,<BR>
But, oh, I'd be glad of my supper to-night.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But presently cometh mine host of the inn,<BR>
And soon from the murghi's there issues a din,<BR>
The heartless khansamah he cares not a jot,<BR>
The dechie is here, but the murghi is not.<BR>
And though it is tough, and not cooked with great care,<BR>
I am not in a mood to complain of my fare.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You may think that travelling hath its delights,<BR>
But wait till you've spent a few weary nights<BR>
In a dak-bungalow, empty and bare,<BR>
With no punka coolie to answer your prayer,<BR>
Then I'm sure you'll agree that a pleasanter lot<BR>
Is to live in a place where dak-bungalows are not.<BR>

Again a dak-bungalow is the theme of my lay,<BR>
But now it is cool, and the close of the day<BR>
Finds me seated outside in my long-armed chair,<BR>
My report to the Burra Sahib now to prepare,<BR>
But, oh, ye great gods, what a discordant din<BR>
Doth break on the peace and contentment within!<BR>
A horde of wild monkeys the compound invade,<BR>
Of every color and age and grade.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A venerable sage cometh close to my chair<BR>
As though he intended my labors to share.<BR>
But his better-half thinks she has by far the best right<BR>
To my paper and pens, should I guard them less tight;<BR>
So she sends him off flying with a howl of pain,<BR>
Then comes back and watches my efforts again;<BR>
Meanwhile, the rest of the tribe chatter and grin,<BR>
Until I think I am being turned outside in.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, where are my dreams of peace and delight&mdash;<BR>
A peg and a smoke in the cool of the night?<BR>
Their noise and their chatter drive all peace away,<BR>
And make we feel minded those monkeys to slay;<BR>
But when I start up and with a stone take a shot,<BR>
The compound is bare, and the monkeys have got;<BR>
They have vanished away like the mist in the sun;<BR>
And, well, after all, they were only in fun.<BR>

It was May in the dear old homeland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the woods and valleys green<BR>
Were a vision of radiant beauty,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For summer now reigned as queen.<BR>
The lark sang high in the heavens,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the air with song,<BR>
And the thrush with its liquid melody<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was glad as the day was long.<BR>
The brooks through the meadows rippled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the sun's bright ray;<BR>
And the whole earth joined in singing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the summer a welcoming lay.<BR>

May, in an Eastern city, under burning skies,<BR>
Where many a weary exile for the dear old homeland cries;<BR>
Only those know the longing and pain<BR>
Who have spent long years on the sun-dried plain,<BR>
Whom days of toil under a pitiless sun<BR>
Have robbed of hope ere the race was won.<BR>
Those who each year are free to go<BR>
To the hills where the cooling breezes blow;<BR>
Where they see afar off the snow-clad peaks,<BR>
And nature in all her beauty speaks,<BR>
Of the weary striving know but the least,<BR>
For they see but the bright side of life in the East.<BR>

A little hill-boy was Buncee, a chokra trusty and true;<BR>
In the days when I was new to the East<BR>
He taught me more than he knew;<BR>
"Ghusl munta, sahib," said he; I doubtfully shook my head;<BR>
"Ghusl na munta," in scandalized tones, but I knew not what he said.<BR>
Then he straightened himself against the wall, and went through a pantomime show<BR>
Of bathing. I smiled and nodded assent;<BR>
It was cute of the boy, you know.<BR>

He was eager to save all the pice he could, that when the season was o'er,<BR>
And the sahibs all left and went down to the plains<BR>
He would have of rupees a store.<BR>
So I became his banker, and locked them away in my case,<BR>
And told him he now must be doubly sure to take every care of the place.<BR>
I returned one day in the midst of the rains, the inner door was locked,<BR>
And when I tried the outer one, I found that it was blocked;<BR>
So I forced my way into the room, and there the youngster lay,<BR>
Stretched out before the outer door, with never a word to say.<BR>

"I have no money to pay this bill, the man can go away;"<BR>
"But, sahib," said Buncee quickly, "there are my rupees, you know."<BR>
Do you wonder I liked the youngster, or that I valued him so?<BR>
And oft in the gloaming I sit and think, and memory backward flies;<BR>
For many there be with hearts as true in that land under Eastern skies.<BR>

Produced by Al Haines

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
